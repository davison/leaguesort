# leaguesort

A simple set of utilities to create a sorted leaguetable based on a 
series of results from matches played between the teams.

Takes an input that is a list of results, returning a sorted array
representing the league table based on those results.  The sorted array
can be passed to a templating library or front-end code for display.

## Installation

    npm install leaguesort --save

## Usage

    var leaguesort = require('leaguesort');



## ToDo

- Enable property mapping for the stats so that callers are not forced
  to use the same input convention
